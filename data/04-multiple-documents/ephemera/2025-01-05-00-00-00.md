# Change Request: Add Project Management Features

**CR-001** | **Priority: Medium** | **Date: 2025-01-05**

## Summary

This change request proposes expanding the Simple Todo App to include basic project management capabilities, allowing users to organize tasks into projects and track progress at both task and project levels.

## Rationale

User feedback indicates that the current single-list approach becomes unwieldy for users managing multiple areas of work or personal projects. Adding project organization will improve task categorization and provide better context for task management.

## Requested Changes

### 1. Project Structure
- Add the ability to create, edit, and delete projects
- Each project should have a name, optional description, and color coding
- Tasks must be assigned to a project (with a default "General" project for unassigned tasks)
- Projects can be archived when completed but remain accessible for reference

### 2. Enhanced Task Management
- Tasks should display their associated project
- Add task filtering by project
- Include project progress indicators (percentage of completed tasks)
- Add task priority levels (High, Medium, Low) within projects

### 3. Project Dashboard
- Create a project overview page showing all projects with progress indicators
- Display recently accessed projects for quick navigation
- Show task counts (total, completed, pending) per project
- Add project-level due dates and milestone tracking

### 4. User Interface Updates
- Add a sidebar or navigation menu for project switching
- Include project selection in the task creation form
- Add bulk operations for moving tasks between projects
- Implement project-based color coding throughout the interface

### 5. Data Model Changes
- Extend the task data model to include project assignment and priority
- Add project entity with metadata (name, description, color, created date, archived status)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing tasks (assign to default project)

## Impact Assessment

- **User Experience**: Moderate impact - adds complexity but provides better organization
- **Technical Complexity**: Medium - requires database schema updates and UI restructuring  
- **Timeline Estimate**: 3-4 weeks development
- **Breaking Changes**: None - existing functionality preserved

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can create projects with names, descriptions, and colors
- [ ] All tasks are assigned to a project (with automatic default project assignment)
- [ ] Project filtering and task organization works correctly
- [ ] Progress tracking displays accurately at project level
- [ ] Existing tasks continue to function without data loss
- [ ] Project dashboard provides clear overview of all projects
- [ ] Bulk task operations between projects work seamlessly
