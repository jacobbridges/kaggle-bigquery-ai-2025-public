closes #67

Hey, I've added support for filtering tasks by timestamp. Let me know if there are any problems with the implementation. ðŸ˜‰ 

This branch includes:
- Adding `timerange_start` and `timerange_end` query params to the listing endpoint.
- Currently, negative (lookback) time ranges are not possible. Can only filter into the future.
- New test cases for the listing endpoint.
