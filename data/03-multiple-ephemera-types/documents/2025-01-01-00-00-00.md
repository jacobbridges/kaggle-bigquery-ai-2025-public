# Simple Todo App Specification

## Overview

A basic web-based todo application that allows users to create, edit, and track personal tasks. Users can add new tasks with a title and optional description, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks they no longer need. The app provides a clean, simple interface focused on helping individuals organize their daily work without complexity or overhead.

The application targets users who need a straightforward way to manage their personal task list without project management features, team collaboration, or advanced scheduling. Tasks are stored persistently so users can access their list across browser sessions. The system will support basic user accounts to keep individual task lists private and separate.
